Title: Tesla Stock Price Prediction

Description: This project aims to predict the stock price of TESLA INC. (TSLA) using historical data and machine learning algorithms.

The project's main objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast the future stock prices of Tesla based on past performance. To achieve this goal, I used a dataset of daily stock prices and volume traded from February 2010 to February 2022. Next step was data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies in the data.

Next, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify potential features that could help predict stock prices. I then used various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to train and evaluate predictive models.
